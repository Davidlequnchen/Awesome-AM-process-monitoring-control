## In-Situ Process Monitoring üîé

Real-time monitoring is crucial for defect detection and quality assurance ([[2404.13673] In-situ process monitoring and adaptive quality enhancement in laser additive manufacturing: a critical review](https://ar5iv.org/pdf/2404.13673#:~:text=This%20paper%20provides%20a%20comprehensive,remediation%20strategies%20that%20advance%20LAM))4‚Ä†L68-L76„Äë. Below, we categorize monitoring approaches by the primary sensing modality:

### Acoustic Signal-Based Monitoring üì¢

High-frequency acoustic emissions can reveal melt pool instabilities and defect formation. Researchers are using microphones or piezoelectric sensors to capture sound from the process and applying ML for anomaly detection.

On the commercial side, machine tools that incorporate a laser or wire DED head alongside CNC milling heads are increasingly used. Research challenges include registration of the part between processes and optimizing **build-mill sequences**.

## Physics-Informed Machine Learning üß†

By fusing physics and ML, these approaches aim for models that require less training data and offer better extrapolation to new conditions.

## AM Robotic Path Planning ü§ñ

Path planning is crucial for directed-energy AM processes (LDED, WAAM, etc.), especially with multi-axis robots. Efficient algorithms are needed to determine the deposition toolpath that ensures uniform material deposition, avoids collisions, and can handle complex geometries or repairs.

*Example:* **RobPath** provides a simple off-line planner for robotic LMD, allowing users to generate deposition toolpaths from a CAD model. In research, advanced planners consider multi-axis orientations to minimize support structures, or adaptive path planning to repair worn parts (e.g., vision-guided path correction in the PROPER project). Continued development in this area helps AM move beyond planar layers to true free-form 3D printing.
